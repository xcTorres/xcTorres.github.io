## Link
problem: [https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

## Description  

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example:**

Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.  

## Solution  
The adding problem is as easy as adding two integers, so we need to calculate remainder and carry.  
But for this problem what we need to pay attention to is that when we traverse the LinkNode, we should check the boundary conditions, such as whether the LinkNode has already been NULL or not.

```java

    /**
    * Definition for singly-linked list.
    * public class ListNode {
    *     int val;
    *     ListNode next;
    *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
    * }
    */
    class Solution {
        public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
            
            ListNode dummy = new ListNode(-1);
            ListNode cur = dummy;
            
            int m,n;
            int carry = 0;
            while(l1 != null || l2 != null){
                m = l1==null?0:l1.val;
                l1 = l1==null?null:l1.next;
                n = l2==null?0:l2.val;
                l2 = l2==null?null:l2.next;
                cur.next = new ListNode((m+n+carry)%10);
                carry = (m+n+carry) / 10;
                cur = cur.next;
            }
            
            if(carry>0)
                cur.next = new ListNode(carry);
            
            return dummy.next;
        }
    }

```
