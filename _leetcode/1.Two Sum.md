problem: [https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

## Description
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

**Example:**

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1]. 

## Solution  

#### Using extra space
We could use a map to store the elements, which could improve the searching efficiency.
```java 

    class Solution {
            public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
                
                Map<Integer, Integer> mapping = new HashMap<>();
                for(int i=0; i<nums.length; i++){
                    if(mapping.containsKey(target-nums[i])){
                        return new int[]{mapping.get(target-nums[i]), i};
                    }else{
                        mapping.put(nums[i], i);
                    }
                }
                return new int[2];
            }
        }

```

#### No extra space  
When we prepare this problem for interview, seems like it is very easy to implement if we could use extra space. If the output requires just the numbers **not the index**, we could solve this without extra space.
The ideas is as follows:  
1. Sort the array(time complexity should be O(nlogn))  
2. Binary Seach(time complexity should be also O(logn)) **or** Two Pointers(time complexity should be also O(n))

So totally the timplexity is O(nlogn)
