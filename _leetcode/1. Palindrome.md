A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam, racecar.  

There are several related problems in Leetcode.    

## [125. Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)  
This question is easy. The first step is to filter out all of the non-alpha and non-num characters. The second step is to use two pointers and compare the characters one by one. 

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        s = ''.join([i for i in s if i.isalnum()])
        start, end = 0, len(s)-1
        while start<end:
            if s[start].lower() == s[end].lower():
                start += 1
                end -= 1
            else:
                return False
        return True
```

## [680. Valid Palindrome II](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome-ii/)  

We can use the standard two-pointer approach that starts at the left and right of the string and move inwards. Whenever there is a mismatch, we can either exclude the character at the left or the right pointer. We then take the two remaining substrings and compare against its reversed and see if either one is a palindrome

```python
class Solution:
    def validPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        i = 0
        j = len(s)-1
        while i < j:
            if s[i] != s[j]:
                delete_i = s[i+1:j+1]
                delete_j = s[i:j]
                return self._isPalindrome(delete_i) or self._isPalindrome(delete_j)
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        return True
    
    def _isPalindrome(self, s):
        return s == s[::-1]   
```

## [5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)  

#### Two Pointers  
Palindrome could have the even length, so we need to skip the duplicates before we further check the characters.
```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        if len(s)<=1:
            return s
        
        res = ''
        for center in range(len(s)):
            i = center
            j = center
            while j+1<len(s) and s[j]==s[j+1]:
                j+=1
            while i>=0 and j<len(s) and s[i]==s[j]:
                i -= 1
                j += 1
            if j-i-1 > len(res):
                res = s[i+1:j]
        return res
```

#### Dynamic Programming
The dynamic programming euqation is as follows:  

$ dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] & (s[i]==s[j]) (i-j>2) $  


```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        
        if len(s)<=1:
            return s
        
        res = ''
        n = len(s)
        dp = [[False]*n for i in range(n)]
        for i in reversed(range(n)):
            for j in range(i, n):
                if (j-i<2 or dp[i+1][j-1]) and s[i]==s[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = True
                    if j-i+1 > len(res):
                        res = s[i:j+1]
        return res
```
