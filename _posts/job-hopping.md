It has been 3 years working in Singapore since I graduated. During the period in Shopee, I learned a lot not only the coding skills but also the understanding of projects. Since Shopee has decided to shift the engineering center to China mainland, the projects that we Singapore team could do are becoming limited, which result in the thoughts to pursue other opportunities.  

There are not many opportunities avaliable in Singapore as expected, some local big company like Lazada and Grab freeze their head count, and the overall situation is bad. But luckily I got my permanent resident before I subimitted my CV, which helps me a lot to have more interview opportunities. Here are recent interview experience, and last I chose to join xxxx.

## Tiktok  
- Machine learning engineer  
I applied for the machine leraning engineer(recomendation), but because of lack of recomendation-related experience, the interviewer in both 2 rounds doesn't have too much interests on my experience. So the coding problem appears to be very important，but I didn't prepare for a long time so coding performance sucks, failed the interview.  
  1st round: Leetcode 3(Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters)  
  2nd round: Leetcode 297(Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree)

- Machine learning engineer(platform governance)  
  1st round: Bert: howt to pretrain; Q, K, V; batch norm and layer norm
