Generative Model & Discriminative  

In General, A Discriminative model ‌models the decision boundary between the classes. A Generative Model ‌explicitly models the actual distribution of each class. A generative model learns the joint probability distribution p(x,y) and a discriminative model learns the conditional probability distribution p(y|x) - which you should read as "the probability of y given x".
