# 态度
**学习语言第一点需要端正态度**  
1)去除恐惧  
2)不怕出错，不怕被judge  
**when you speak, don’t focus on yourself. Focus on other people and the result you want to achieve. 
English is not an art to be mastered.It is just a tool to get the result.**

## 听力
在上班的工作中，用英语交流还仍有障碍，为了以后自己职业更好的发展，听力和口语都有待提高。在网上看了一些帖子，得到了一些启发，纠正了自己以往的学习方法。现在才真正明白了以下几个道理。  
- 对我这种基础比较差的泛听是没有什么卵用的。精听才是王道  
- 如果听力不好，其他听说读写没有一项会好。这些都是一连串的连锁反应。不能再找借口说自己写作和阅读能力不错了。  

为了提高听力，遂从今日3月6日开始，先开启为期一个月的精听模式，再分析学习方法是否适用于我。听力材料为每日英语听力中VOA慢速英语。  
1） 先将听到的内容写下来。不会的地方空下来（可以多听几遍）  
2） 查看答案，并查明空下来单词的原因，是发音的问题还是的确是生词词汇。  
3） 复听几遍，并跟读，纠正发音才能更好地提高听力。  
4） 第二天再听新听力之前，需重复听几遍前一天的听力，确保都能够听懂。
