Moreover, recommender systems are usually classified into the following categories, based on how recommendations are made:  
  * __Content-based recommendations__: The user will be recommended items similar to the ones the user  preferred in the past
  * __Collaborative recommendations__: The user will be recommended items that people with similar tastes and   preferences liked in the past;  
  * __Hybrid approaches__: These methods combine collaborative and content-based methods.
