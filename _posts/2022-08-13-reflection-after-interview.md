It has been 3 years working in Singapore since I graduated. During the period in Shopee, I learned a lot not only the coding skills but also the understanding of projects. Since Shopee has decided to shift the engineering center to China mainland, the projects that we Singapore team could do are becoming limited, which result in the thoughts to pursue other opportunities.  

There are not many opportunities avaliable in Singapore as expected, some local big company like Lazada and Grab freeze their head count, Amreican company like Google and facebook also don't have enough engineer head count. I got my permanent resident before I subimitted my CV, which helps me a lot to have more interview opportunities. Here are recent interview experience, unluckily I don't have any offer due to short of time to fully prepare.

# Interview  
#### Tiktok  
- **Machine learning engineer(recommendation)**  
Because of lack of recomendation-related experience, the interviewer in both 2 rounds doesn't have too much interests on my experience. So the coding problem appears to be very importantï¼Œbut I didn't prepare for a long time so coding performance sucks, failed the interview.  
  1st round: Leetcode 3(Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters)  
  2nd round: Leetcode 297(Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree)

- **Machine learning engineer(platform governance)**  
1st round: Bert: howt to pretrain; Q, K, V; batch norm and layer norm  
             How does GBDT do classfication?
             How to pretrain your own Bert?

#### Indeed  
The coding problem is easy, merge 2 sorted array. Here are some machine learning related problems.  
1. Unfair coin(Bayesian probability)  
2. Overfitting and underfitting  
3. Variance, boosting and bagging  
4. Dropout mechanisum


#### Apple
Coding: Top k frequent elements  
word2vec, Search System introduction Bilstm-CRF


#### Huawei
leetcode: lognest valid parentheses, coin change  


#### Grab  
leetcode 1011

# Reflection  
To be honest, I am frustrated for a while, but I think I deserve it because I didn't fully prepare the coding and related machine learning knowledge on the CV. Right now I don't have chance and have to change my mind to look for new roles at the end of the year. It is not too bad because I have 4 months to prepare, this time I don't have any excuse. First I need to know which position I should apply for, I think machine learning engineer(search or NLP) should be more related, it is also okay if the job needs me to still work on map-related projects except assignment field. So there should be these things to prepare as follows:  

- Coding: [Leetcode](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l7Gvrubuscs0iwDPov053wGWV_uNg0yK_991JDeNIH0/edit#gid=2023823697)
- NLP: Word2vec, HMM, CRF, RNN, Bi-lstm, Bi-lstm-CRF, Bert  
- Search: Query correction, NER, search engine  
- Recommendation: 
- Machine learnning skills: Linear regression, xgboost, bias and variance, underfitting and overfitting
- Probability: Bayesian rules, p value, optimization algorithm
- SQL
