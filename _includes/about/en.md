### Work Experience  

**Shopee Data Scientist**  
Jul 2019 - Present , Singapore
- The batch assignment is a project of Foody, which is used to assign the orders to shippers in global optimization(one shipper is allowed to accept one order only). In v1, the mean of Single assign successfully rate is increased from 95.29% to 97.15%, the average of Assign ignore rate has been reduced from 24.36% to 13.67%, the average of time from auto-assign to last-in charge has been reduced from 17.05s to 13.75s. In v2, we add a machine learning model(xgboost) to predict the shipper ignore rate instead of using the historical statistics data. As a result, in v2 the mean of Single assign ignore rate has been reduced from 13% to 10%.


**Huawei Wuhan   Intern**  
Sep 2018 – Jun 2019 , Wuhan, China  
- Participate in developing a HBase-based spatio-temporal database system for storing vector objects, which is an innovative project of Huawei in the field of IoT.  
- Design the spatio-temporal index and improve the performance of range query and k-NN query, making the average query time under 100 ms.  

**DiDi   Intern**  
Jun 2018 – Sep 2018 , Beijing, China  
- Participate in utilizing the machine learning model to provide the appropriate drop-off point for the destination, saving passenger’s time and walking cost.
- Combine the features of POI, passengers, drivers, road, etc. ,and utilize GBDT model to screen out important features, resulting in 10% decrease the MAE of destination deviation.
