## Link
problem: [https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/)  

Use dijkstra algorithms, but what is different is that we need to store the stops that are used to check with given K. In terms of cenrtain node, not only the minimal cost should we store, but also we need to store all of the costs from origin point to this node. Here we use the priority queue, so the costs will be sorted and popped one by one. If any stop is greater than given K. We will drop this cost and use greater cost.  

## Solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def findCheapestPrice(self, n, flights, src, dst, K):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type flights: List[List[int]]
        :type src: int
        :type dst: int
        :type K: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        graph = {}
        for flight in flights:
            s, d, price = flight
            if s not in graph:
                graph[s] = {d: price}
            else:
                graph[s][d] = price
        
        dis = [sys.maxsize] * n
        dis[src] = 0
        queue = []
        heapq.heappush(queue, (0, src, -1))
        while queue:
            min_dis, u, stops= heapq.heappop(queue)
            if u == dst:
                return min_dis
            if u not in graph or stops >= K:
                continue
            for end, cost in graph[u].items():
                heapq.heappush(queue, (min_dis+cost, end, stops+1))

        return -1
```
