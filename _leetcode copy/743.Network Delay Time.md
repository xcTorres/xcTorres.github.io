## Solution
#### General dijkstra
```python
    class Solution:    
        def networkDelayTime(self, times: List[List[int]], N: int, K: int) -> int:
            
            # init the graph using matrix
            graph = []
            for i in range(N):
                tmp = [sys.maxsize]*N
                tmp[i] = 0
                graph.append(tmp)
                
            for t in times:
                start, end, cost = tuple(t)
                graph[start-1][end-1] = cost

            for count in range(N):

            for d in dist:
                if d == sys.maxsize:
                    return -1
                res = max(res, d)
                
            return res
```  

#### Priority Queue
